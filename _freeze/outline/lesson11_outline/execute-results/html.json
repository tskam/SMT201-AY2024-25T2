It is a key element in urban planning and management since it is a direct expression of mobility either in terms of people, freight, or information within a city or between cities. In this lesson, you will learn the basic concepts of **Geography of Accessibility**. You will also gain hands-on experience on using both build in and plug-in network analysis functions of QGIS to derive accessibility indexes.\n\n## Content\n\n-   Why analyse with network?\n-   Deriving hexagon layer,\n-   Extracting, clean and process network data from roads layer of OSM data, and\n-   Performing network accessibility by using network analysis tools of QNEAT plug-in.\n\n## Lesson Slides and Hands-on Notes\n\n-   Lesson slides in [html](../lesson/Lesson11/Lesson11.html) format.\n\n-   Hands-on Exercises:\n\n    -   [Geography of Accessibility: QGIS methods](https://gis4urbplan.netlify.app/hands-on_ex10)\n\n## References\n\n### Concepts and Methods\n\n-   Manfred M.
