## Overview

**Accessibility** is the measure of the capacity of a location to be reached from, or to be reached by, different locations. It is a key element in urban planning and management since it is a direct expression of mobility either in terms of people, freight, or information within a city or between cities. In this lesson, you will learn the basic concepts of **Geography of Accessibility**. You will also gain hands-on experience on using both build in and plug-in network analysis functions of QGIS to derive accessibility indexes.

## Content

-   Why analyse with network?
-   Deriving hexagon layer,
-   Extracting, clean and process network data from roads layer of OSM data, and
-   Performing network accessibility by using network analysis tools of QNEAT plug-in.
