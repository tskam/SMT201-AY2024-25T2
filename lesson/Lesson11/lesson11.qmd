## Content

-   Why monitoring urban land cover change?
-   Urban land cover change detection methods:
    -   Pre- and Post-Classification Change Detection,
    -   Pixel-Based Change Detection, and\
    -   Object-Based Change Detection.

## Pre- and Post-Classification Change Detection

This method involves classifying land cover in images from different time periods and then comparing the classified maps to identify changes.

## Pixel-Based Change Detection

This approach directly compares pixel values in different images to detect changes.

## Object-Based Change Detection

This method analyzes images by grouping pixels into objects, which are then compared to identify changes.

## Post-Classification Comparison Change Detection

## OBIA, or Object-Based Image Analysis

OBIA is a technique that segments an image into distinct objects (or segments) based on spatial, spectral, and textural characteristics, and then classifies these objects rather than individual pixels.

## How it works?

- Segmentation: The first step is to segment the image into homogeneous regions (objects) using algorithms that consider pixel similarity. 
- Feature Extraction: Once the objects are created, features like spectral, spatial, and textural properties are extracted from each object. 
- Classification: Finally, these extracted features are used to classify each object into a predefined class. 

## Advantages of OBIA

- Improved Accuracy: By analyzing objects rather than pixels, OBIA can lead to more accurate classifications, especially for complex scenes. 

- Reduced Noise: OBIA can help reduce noise and improve the reliability of the classification results. 

- Efficiency: OBIA can be more efficient than pixel-based classification, especially for high-resolution images. 

- Applicability: OBIA can be applied to a variety of applications, including land use/land cover classification, forest mapping, mineral mapping, coastal zone studies, crop classification, and urban studies. 

##  Applications of OBIA

- Land Use/Land Cover Classification: Identifying different types of land cover, such as forests, fields, and urban areas. 

- Forest Mapping: Mapping different types of forests and assessing forest health. 

- Mineral Mapping: Identifying and mapping different types of minerals. 
Coastal Zone Studies: Analyzing and mapping coastal zones and their features. 

- Crop Classification: Identifying different types of crops and assessing their health. 

- Urban Studies: Analyzing and mapping urban areas and their features.
