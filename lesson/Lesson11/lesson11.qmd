## What is Geography of Accessibility?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Accessibility is the measure of **the capacity of a location to be reached from, or to be reached by, different locations**. Therefore, the capacity and the arrangement of transport infrastructure are key elements in the determination of accessibility.

### Why Model Geography of Accessibility?

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Questions that can be answered by accessibility models:
    -   Which part of the geographical areas are deprived from getting access to a social service, facility or job opportunity?
    -   Which part of the geographical areas will be affected by a public policy or business decision such as merging JCs, secondary and primary schools.

## Measuring Distances

-   Different spatial and distance conceptualizations that are commonly employed when measuring and modelling accessibility.

### Distance Consideration

Cartesian distance versus Network distance.

### The distance friction

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Modeling spatial interactions implies quantifying the **distance friction** or **impedance**.
-   The role of the distance can be interpreted as a disincentive to access desired destinations or opportunities (e.g. jobs, shops).

::: notes
The perception of how far a destination is may not be a linear function of distance. People are more likely to shop at a place close to home than one far away. Distance is viewed as a nonlinear deterrent to movement. This phenomenon can be modeled by using a distance-decay function. The use of a power distance-decay function is borrowed from Newton's law of gravitation, from which the term gravity model is derived. A distance-decay parameter, symbolized by the Greek letter beta, can be used to exaggerate the distance to destinations. Some activities, such as grocery shopping, have a large exponent, indicating that people will travel only a short distance for such things. Other activities, such as furniture shopping, have a small exponent, because people are willing to travel farther to shop for furniture.

## The Geographical Unit

-   This issue of irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process).

![](img/image7.jpg)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Geographical Unit

-   Using regular shaped geometry such as square, hexagon or triangle to define geographical unit.

![](img/image1.png)

::: notes
In GIS analysis, regularly shaped grids is used for many reasons such as normalizing geography for mapping or to mitigate the issues of using irregularly shaped polygons created arbitrarily (such as county boundaries or block groups that have been created from a political process). Regularly shaped grids can only be comprised of equilateral triangles, squares, or hexagons, as these three polygon shapes are the only three that can tessellate (repeating the same shape over and over again, edge to edge, to cover an area without gaps or overlaps) to create an evenly spaced grid.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### The Geographical Unit

-   Hexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon.
-   A circle has the lowest ratio but cannot tessellate to form a continuous grid. Hexagons are the most circular-shaped polygon that can tessellate to form an evenly spaced grid.\]

::: notes
Though the square (fishnet) grid is the predominantly used shape type in GIS analysis and thematic mapping, there are ways in which hexagons may be better suited for your analysis based on the nature of your question.

Hexagons reduce sampling bias due to edge effects of the grid shape, this is related to the low perimeter-to-area ratio of the shape of the hexagon.

## Accessibility Measure: Distance to Nearest Location

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The formula:

![](img/image15.jpg)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Limitation of the method:

-   Does not consider the size/attractiveness of the closest location, thereby implicitly treating all locations as being equally attractive.
-   Does not consider the cumulative effect of multiple accessible locations (e.g. is a zone that is within 1.1 km of two MRT stations inferior to one that is within 1.0 km of a single station?
:::
:::::

## Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM)

The formula:

![](img/image13.jpg)

where

-   *Aai* is the accessibility in ED *i*,
-   *nj* is the capacity of the target facility *j*.
-   *pi* is the demand of this ED, and
-   *dij* is the network distance between the *EDi* and each facility *j*.
