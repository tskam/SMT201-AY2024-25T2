GIS with its capability to capture, manage, display, and analyse information spatially is emerging as one of the important enabling tool in smart city planning.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to practical applications of GIS in smart city management and planning. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nlocating, acquiring and integrating multi-sources of data into GIS,\nunderstand the principles and methodologies of geocoding and geo referencing ,\nbecome familiar with geovisualisation and GIS analysis techniques, and\nexplore the technologies and possibilities of GIS-enabled Planning Support Systems for smart city management."

    "text": "Topic\nIn recent years, a slew of record-breaking natural disasters has devastated communities around the world with unprecedented intensity and frequency. For example, in this September, the world saw two devastating disaster events within two days of each other, namely the Morocco earthquake on 8th September 2023 and Libya flood caused by the collapsed of Derna dam on 10th September 2023. Both have caused large-scale destruction of infrastructure and thousands of tragic deaths and injuries. As this worrying trend shows no signs of slowing, the importance of investing in and incorporating advanced Geographic Information (GI) technologies into each phase of the disaster planning and response framework cannot be overstated. While we cannot stop disasters from happening completely, GI technologies can mitigate risk and damages to infrastructure by helping to track, predict, and prepare for disasters, and ultimately assist in recovery and relief.\nAssume the role of being a GIS team of an international organisation focusing on humanitarian affairs and disaster mitigation and management, your team are tasked to explore the potential used of GIS and remote sensing technologies in urban flood disaster mitigation and management. The used case must be developed based on the recent Libya dam collapsed and its subsequent flooding of Derna City.\nYou are required to choose one of the theme provided below:\n\nTheme 1: Urban Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection for Flood Mapping Applications of Satellite Remote Sensing.\nTheme 2: GIS-based Accessibility Analysis and Mapping of Emergency Evacuation Centres and Medical Services.\nTheme 3: Integrating GIS and Remotely Sensed Data for Urban Flood Loss Assessment and Recovery Planning."
