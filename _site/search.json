    "text": "Effective planning and management of smart cities require urban planners to integrate and share data from multiple sources to the urban users so that they can be active participants in the smart city planning process. GIS with its capability to capture, manage, display, and analyse information spatially is emerging as one of the important enabling tool in smart city planning.\nThis course provides students with an introduction to practical applications of GIS in smart city management and planning. Emphasis will be placed on:\n\nlocating, acquiring and integrating multi-sources of data into GIS,\nunderstand the principles and methodologies of geocoding and geo referencing ,\nbecome familiar with geovisualisation and GIS analysis techniques, and\nexplore the technologies and possibilities of GIS-enabled Planning Support Systems for smart city management."

Knowledge of the data, and of the classes desired, is required before classification.\nBy identifying patterns, you can instruct the computer system to identify pixels with similar characteristics.

It builds upon the concept of decision trees (DT).\nThe RF relies on many self-learning decision trees (i.e. “Forest”). The idea behind using many decision trees (i.e. an ensemble) is that many base learners can come to one strong and robust decision compared to a single DT.\nDifferent from the manual (expert-based) definition of decision rules, the RF uses self-learning decision trees. These trees automatically define rules at each node based on a training dataset.\nRF seeks to minimize the heterogeneity of the two resulting subsets of the data created by the respective rule. Heterogeneity is in this case expressed as the Gini impurity index and the rule creating the least heterogeneous subsets of the data is used for the respective node."

Urban managers carry the crucial responsibility of making decisions that shape the economic future of their communities.\nThese decisions extend far beyond merely deciding where businesses should be located. They require a careful analysis of potential economic impacts, such as job creation, tax revenue, environmental sustainability, and long-term community benefits. In this regard, data plays a pivotal role in helping city managers make informed decisions that maximize positive outcomes for local economies.\nGeospatial data, particularly the location of businesses, enables urban managers to move beyond guesswork, relying on empirical evidence for decision-making. By analyzing the distribution of businesses from previous planning periods, urban planners can identify gaps in land-use planning, such as areas where certain types of businesses are underrepresented. Recognising these gaps empowers planners to revise, refine, and recommend more effective land-use strategies for the upcoming planning period."
